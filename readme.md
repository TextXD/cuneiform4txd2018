# Bilingual Embeddings: Sumerian and Akkadian
TextXD 2018
This repository provides word embeddings in Sumerian and Akkadian. The embeddings were created in the Fasttext implementation in gensim. The data come from the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus ([ORACC](http://oracc.org)). The repository includes code for loading and exploring the models.

# The challenge
Is it possible to align Sumerian and Akkadian?
