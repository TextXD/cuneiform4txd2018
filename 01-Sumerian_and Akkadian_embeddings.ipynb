    "# Sumerian and Akkadian Word Embeddings\n",
    "By Niek Veldhuis, Department of Near Eastern Studies, UC Berkeley\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook loads Sumerian and Akkadian word embedding models and gives some hints for how to explore these models. Will someone be brave enough to try and align the two models?\n",
    "\n",
    "The data derive from the Open Richly Annotated Cuneiform Corpus ([ORACC](http://oracc.org)) created by Steve Tinney (UPenn) and dircted by Jamie Novotny (Munich), Eleanor Robson (UC London), Steve Tinney (UPenn), and Niek Veldhuis (UC Berkeley).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sumerian texts used in this model date between 2,500 BCE and 0; the corpus is dominated by a group of about 70,000 administrative texts from around 2,050 BCE dealing with animals, grain, labor, precious objects, etc. The entire corpus used here has about about 4.3 million words. The Akkadian corpus ranges from ca. 2,000 BCE to 0 and consists primarily of library texts, royal inscriptions, royal correspondence, and royal administartion, for a total of some 1.5 million words. Sumerian was spoken in the deep South of present day Iraq in the third millennium - afterwards it became a language of scholarship and religion. Akkadian was spoken in Babylonia and Assyria - roughly the same cultural area where Sumerian was at home.\n",
